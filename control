Description: XMPPFramwork (https://github.com/robbiehanson/XMPPFramework) is a popular iOS/Objective-C framework for XMPP communication. It uses CocoaAsyncSocket (https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaAsyncSocket) to open a socket. The XMPP standard requires TLS so tcpdump is inadequate to listen to what is being communicated. This tweak hooks into CocoaAsyncSocket/GCDAsyncSocket's writeData method and its delegate method didReadData in XMPPStream to log messages sent and received by XMPPFramework.
